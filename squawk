If you see something say something that's what they tell you to

Tattle on your friends and neighbors; 
It's the right thing to do

Put a magnet on your moral compass

If Sisyphus is rolling a boulder up a hill on a train track and midway up there a switch to divert his course to roll directly over the newly refurbished ship of Theseus with the matching vin and a salvage title. What would you do and who would you tell?

A trailer with an expired tag

What can you see from inside my boots
My dog is off her leash 

If your dog gets shot it probably had a gun


My dog is off her leash, and she has a gun; so if she gets shot, you better run because she's also invincible. But she's friendly, and she's never barked first when greeting another dog. So she probably won't shoot first either

The laws are there to keep you safe, and still alive because you pay taxes

If you see a man break into one of Stacy's 30 vacancies, you could tell on him and have him forcibly removed. And insurance covers any damages. 

That's what you get for being homeless

If you see a lawn care van spraying chemicals, that could probably kill some kids or animals, and of course leech into our waterways

Can I install spikes on my front lawn? Probably not, but how about thistle? Not in a HOA
But I can spray pesticides, yeehaw. 
If you're trespassing and succumb to my toxic lawn, that sucks

If you see something say something. 

The red and blue do what they do. And you can't do a damn thing about it. Resistance is illegal. So is a bunch of other things that we never even got a say in. 
If you see something say something. 

Let me know if you've seen my representation. Because I've got my documents. And I don't qualify for any exemptions. At least not yet while I'm still broke. At least I have valid insurance. Thanks mom
