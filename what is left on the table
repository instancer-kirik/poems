## what is left on the table

tables are never boundless, lest players never take a seat.
The scene sprawls out before you; the encounters creep up from behind.
If you turn your back and run, you can make it out alive. 

But what desire has for want is what is felt but left undone.

As play continues, we approach the good parts.

The tire turns tomorrow..  The bump in the road..  The fall of the log;

Get out and fetch an axe. 
unable to wield this weapon effectively with present stats.
It is not you that cuts the log.
Not now. Not ever. 
Unless of course, you are ready.

### To the one with the grin and grip.

Match the strike with the stricken.
Bark, rip or chop to cleave a chip.
One must drop all their rings when hitten

There is no log, it was only an obstacle

you can't pick every encounter, but you can choose how to respond. 
What's your initiative? Role for directive.

Collect your things; it's time to go.

### what is left on the table

the ups and down of tales and trails
The higher up you are, the less you are lost
For if up is askew; and sit down for this next part.
With a quaternion, there is no forward.
You cannot face your versor.
SLERP to your next perspective,
and take it from there.


take the next right;
arrive at a destination.
do something.
tell the story a different way.
