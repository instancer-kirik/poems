## How to write a poem
First, a new canvas - a space to place your words.
Persistent and accessible;
A hard or soft medium, of course it matters. 
Paper is a great place to start.
Though I prefer digital for the inherent integrated editing experience.

Write wherever; copy, print and proceed.

You may declare a title, 
though titles are not necessary.

Then some text to edit and language to twist. 
List additional words and form some phrases.
An idea or theme may come to emerge.

Once some lines are written, some meaning may start to develop.
This meaning might be astonishing, banal, or confusing 
if you just let the words lead. 

In a separate place, perhaps a new stanza, wait, and think. 

Form your thoughts and cohere a cogent takeaway; 
something to write about.

As you're pondering or showering or wandering, 
come up with a phrase to fit the script
or a thought to further the plot;
such threads give way for substance, while
rhymes and rhythm impact the order of characters.
And in regard to impact--consider your delivery. 

Cadence is like rocks in a river.
Of the ends of things and transitions to next; 
of inflections or modulations of the voice,
how it falls or rises, affecting the delivery and feel.

Some flows may feel familiar, 
like the ride of tension and release and buildup and bassdrop
But, set the tempo to the beat of your own drum. 
And climax how you desire.

Phrasing,, and synonyms. 

Also, punctuation cues for pace..

And sometimes you might want to repeat things for structure or emphasis.

Between the lines lies the subtext, but between the silence and space lies the words.

You can arrange characters in any sequence, but you cannot escape words.

With semantics sufficiently marked, and your multiple meanings managed,
know that your reader will interpret however they want.
So write the poem that you want to write anyway; however you want it written.

Then your stanzas stack to swaying stories 
and your words shift in the editorial gust

Now what? I have words in a file. 
Print it or show it or keep it;
upload to the internet. 

How should I show it?
I'm just gonna take screenshots of this.
But you can choose backgrounds or fonts or special presentation.

And to what end? 
For funds or fulfillment or sharing some sentiment or something. 

Results oriented poetry could fail to impact as intentioned, while
Action/Process oriented poetry should offer better results.

Such is the plasticity of poetry, enjoy and ingest
